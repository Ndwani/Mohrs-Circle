# Mohrs-Circle
A small module that aids in solveing for principle stresses, max shear stress , stress state at given orientation and plots the Mohr circle.
This is a personal project in which i made an attempt to code the process of dealings 2D stress related problems
This module created, works in conjuction with numpy and matplot which aid in solving the stress formulae and subsequently plot the mohr circle when requested.

# NOTE:
1. Multiple instances(objects) solving for the stresses can be run simultaneously. However, the same does not apply when calling the plot method to plot the mohr circle.
2. This is project is in working progress

 # Background
A summary of what the module does
